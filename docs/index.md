# Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Over the past four years of studying Electrical Engineering and Electronics at LUT University, I have worked on numerous practical projects that demonstrate my skills and passion for the field. This site serves as a showcase of that work.

Feel free to explore my projects via the "Projects" tab! Not all of them have been included here yet and more are very likely to be coming soon!

## My strengths / interests / key skills that I have developed over the years

- Strong system-level perception. I have a good grasp of projects and even large-scale entities, and I quickly understand how a project should be implemented.

**My main interests are in:**

-**General electronics** (small signals, power regulation, pcb design, good EMI practices) and **Power electronics**

  - **Wearable electronics**. Dealing with battery operated very high efficiency mixed signal measurement boards
  - Measurement devices, controllers, espcially antything that can be held in hands and has a direct practical application! 

-**Embedded Electronics / Embedded systems**

-**Embedded coding (RTOSes, C, C++)**

  - I have exprience with Zephyr RTOS and FreeRTOS, pure C and Arduino / ESP32 C++ stuff 
  - I have also some experience on the Zybo Z7 and STM32 platforms

-**3D printing / mechanical design**

  - Calibrating printer (flow, pressure advance, speed / quality, tolerances, diagnosing various issues), understading different materials and their behaviour (strength / quality).
  - Experience with Creality Ender 3 S1 pro, Creality K1C and Bambulabs X1 Enterprice. I currently own a temperamental K1C.
