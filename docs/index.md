# Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Over the past four years of studying Electrical Engineering and Electronics at LUT University, I have worked on numerous practical projects that demonstrate my skills and passion for the field. This site serves as a showcase of that work.

Feel free to explore my projects via the "Projects" tab! The portfolio is a work in progress and will be updated as I finish new projects!

## My Key Skills & Interests

Here is a quick summary of my skills and interests

-**System-level thinking**

  - I have typically a good grasp of the "big picture", and I understand how different pieces come together.
  - I prioritize understanding how things work at a fundamental level.

-**Electronics design**

  - Small Signals, Mixed Signals, Power Regulation, PCB Design, Good EMI Practices, Controllers and Power Electronics.
  - Wearable electronics: Dealing with battery operated high efficiency mixed signal measurement boards.
  - Measurement boards and IMUs: I have work experience with custom measurement boards based on inertial measurement sensors (IMU) and magnetometers.
  - I am especially interested in anything that can be held in hands and has a direct practical application!


-**Embedded systems**

  - Programming: C, C++
  - Other languages I have used: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - RTOS: I have experience with Zephyr RTOS and FreeRTOS 
  - Platforms: I have worked with nRF52 / nRF52840, Zybo Z7 (Zynq 7000), ESP32 and STM32 platforms

-**Control systems and Digital Signal Processing**

  - Motivation: I view mathematics and control theory as powerful tools in Embedded Systems. I have taken extra courses and built personal projects to master these tools for practical applications.
  - DSP: I am interested in digital filters and algorithms. I have experience with complementary filtering and digital LPF / HPF filtering
  - IMU dataprocessing: I have work experience with human measurements based on IMU sensors.
    
    - I have implemented a complementary filter for angle calculation.
    - I have studied magnetic sensor calibration and various other calibration methods relating to 3D orientation and its calculation.
    - Future goal: Implementing a Kalman filter for IMU sensor orientation processing on Embedded Hardware.


-**3D printing and mechanical design**

  - 3D Modelling: SolidWorks, OnShape.
  - Calibration: flow, pressure advance, speed / quality, tolerances, diagnosing various issues. 
  - Process knowledge: Understanding how different materials affect the printing process and the end result (strength / quality).
  - I have experience with Creality Ender 3 S1 pro, Creality K1C and Bambu Lab X1 Enterprise. 
    - I currently own a temperamental K1C.
