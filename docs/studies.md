    - Key takeaways: Im definitely not  the best at maths but I like it! Numerical mathematics / methods support programming and digital dataprocessing nicely!

  - C-ohjelmointi (C-programming)
    - Key takeaways: Basic experience in C-language. Pointers, variable types, memory handlign (malloc) etc.

  - Olio-ohjelmointi (Object-oriented programming)
    - Key takeaways: Object-oriented thinking, general software development, Java / Android studio

  - Säätötekniikan perusteet (Basics of control)
    - Key takeaways: I have a love hate relationship with control engineering. Very interesting and extremely usefull stuff but requires time to understand.

  - Digital Control 1
    - Key takeaways: Very interesting course. I took this course purely for my own enjoyment as an extra.

  - Electronics Project 
    - Key takeaways: Masters level project course. We did a project for Biovaaka Oy. Learned a lot about working for a real customer. My role was software developer / bluetooth expert.

  - Electronics Laboratory 1 / 2 (laboratory / project courses), Analog Electronics 1 / 2 (laboratory / project courses), Basics of Electronics 2 (project course)
    - Key takeaways: I have strong background in practical hands on work with electronics and teamwork. I like projects where you get to solve problems and learn through practical experience.

  - Introduction to Embedded Systems / Introduction Embedded System Programming
    - Key takeaways:
      - I was able to deepen my interest in embedded systems.
      - I purchased a Zybo Z7 board, which is used in the course.  The programming course as a projcet work and the task is to implement converter code. I had a good grasp of the project from the beginning and was appointed as the project manager. I delegate tasks, design system architecture / structure, and implement the final code merge on my own Zybo.
