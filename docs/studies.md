## Studies

I am currently a first-year Master's student at university (4th year overall). I am looking for Master's thesis opportunities!

**Bachelors**:  

  - Major: Industrial Electronics / Teollisuuselektroniikka
  - Thesis: ["System-level implementation of a wearable device suitable for motion analysis using the nRF52840 SoC"](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2025052353392)
  - GPA: 4.75 (180 credits)

**Masters**:

  - Major: Electronics
  - Minor: Software Engineering / Ohjelmistotuotanto

## My favourite / otherwise relevant courses:

  - Applied Mathematics 1 _(on-going)_
    - Key takeaways: Numerical mathematics / numerical methods support programming and digital dataprocessing nicely!

  - C-ohjelmointi (C-programming)
    - Key takeaways: Experience in C-language. Pointers, variable types, memory handling (malloc) etc.

  - Olio-ohjelmointi (Object-oriented programming)
    - Key takeaways: Object-oriented programming model and thinking, general software development, Java / Android studio

  - Introduction to Web Development
    - Key takeaways: CSS, JavaScript, HTML. Gained some experience with web development tools (AJAX, Leaflet, Bootstrap, Interaction with APIs, JSON manipulation)! Built a weather app website as my project work and achieved full points!

  - Basics of Control Engineering
    - Key takeaways:
      - Gained a solid understanding of system analysis, stability analysis (Bode, Nyquist, Root Locus), and the fundamentals of control loops

  - Digital Control 1 _(on-going)_
    - Key takeaways: 
      - Deep dive into discrete control systems, discretization, state-space models.
      - Very interesting course. I took this course purely for my own enjoyment as an extra.

  - Electronics Project 
    - Key takeaways: Masters level project course. We did a project for a company. Learned a lot about working for a real customer. My role was software developer / Bluetooth developer.

  - Electronics Laboratory 1 / 2 (laboratory / project courses), Analog Electronics 1 / 2 (laboratory / project courses) and Basics of Electronics 2 (project course)
    - Key takeaways: I have strong background in practical laboratory work with electronics. I like projects where you get to solve problems and learn through practical experience.

  - Introduction to Embedded Systems and Introduction Embedded System Programming (on-going)
    
    - Key takeaways:

      - I was able to deepen my interest in embedded systems.
      - I purchased a Zybo Z7 board, which is used in the course. The programming course as a project work and the task is to implement converter code. I had a good grasp of the project from the beginning and was appointed as the project manager. I delegate tasks, design system architecture / structure, and implement the final code merge on my own Zybo.
